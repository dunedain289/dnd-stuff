Mack and his cell need rescue. Us messing up the cult/hand made just enough space for them to evac. For their next job, they set up raid in Zephrynell - but that Eye tried to move into the power vacuum. Meant extra forces mustered. Mack is in over his head. Goal was both prison break and supply raid. 

Meet up with lieutenant covering safe house. Told about strike into Z and new news. 

Routes into city - drainage sewer (sneak), main gate (disguise). Mack and team went in though main gate - can fake better as locals though.
