reach bottom of shaft
met a myconid sprout (little mushroom person)
talked stalwart down from killing it
irethia telepathy'd with hive mind
found out about an aboleth + pestilence
      aboleth is cthulu style great old one usually in ocean
      really really nasty
      older than the gods
found another mushroom and shining stalagtite

stalwart accuses yusef of being evil (fiend)
         insight 9 (17 irethia, figures out slightly untruthful)

stalwart suggests lynching, conor defends yusef
yusef admits fiendish nature, demands answers from irethia
yusef's sorcerer part is from somewhere fiendish
gets offered ring from yusef, which lights stalwarts' senses
irethia cannot remove similar ring
other mercs get nervous about yusef's concern
stalwart religion checks that celestials are from heaven (4 :( )
i id ring as fiendish + arcane

randall puts ring on to have a conversation with passenger
        his arms light up with fire
        redvasil of the ashen guard
        wanted to kill tiamat
        ring seems to bind fiend to this world
        kind of a bad dude, but bound to the ring

yusef has wares to sell
walks and talks down to stalagmite
asks about daina's cursed helm and scary eyes
daina tries to get scary (fails ;p )

stalwart bargains badly for a fancy shield (stalwart discount)

somehow, conor talks yusef into ring (something about a brother and a life for a life)

no undead
big fucking fiend within 6 miles

daina inspected an ice stalagmite
her whelming axe didn't do anything
then her dad's axe shattered it, and we found some bubbling lava (WTF)
there was something magical about that spot

the dwarf merc asks her about the blade

there's a duergar fortress somewhere, the axe broke their magic

one of the mercs (bartram) is both desecrated and blessed
their cleric (or tibbers) seems to have worked on things
he's got a heart of diamond, they fixed it (sort of)
seems he was raised that way

we found nocturnus
he killed another one of the little myconids
looking super scary, killed it with the scary black sword
daina tried to take the sword from him, couldn't, tackled him
then an arrow streaked into the area, wayne caught it and sent it back

combat!

* daina, finn and i weren't surprised
* nocturnus got webbed and grappled and pulled into pestilence (3d8 dmg)
* daina sliced a cave fisher and cut the web on nocturnus
* i smacked a drider w/ hunters mark
* finn did the same
* barden got his beard lit on fire, then ran through alcoholic cave blood and lit it on fire, and took 6 dmg
    managed only 1 roll w/ dmg, with alcoholic blood, and a fiery beard (lit more area on fire)
* randall nearly got webbed, but stalwart blocked
* nocturnus nearly got webbed again and again and again
* *in undercommon* "Save The Prince"
* Dreider casts magic darkness blocked by Sprocket
* Dreider casts fairy fire
    bartram got highlightered
* darkness got counterspelled again
* final round of darkness actually happened, covered daina and nocturnus
* i fired into darkness at drider, lucky hit first round
* barden got grappled and pulled back and restrained, but out of fire
* finn critted a spider and then killed it with second arrow
* stalwart shield bashed and stabbed a spider
* randall dispelled the darkness
* nocturnus got out of the pestilence
* barden got untangled from a cave fisher, then attacked
* stalwart almost got webbed
* daina almost got webbed
* nocturnus got webbed, then bit
* irethia throws a fireball, hits 6 enemies + barden, explodes a cave fisher (chain splosions), then tried a firebolt
* another darknes, counterspelled by irethia
* sprocket fireballed, hit 3 spiders, a draegloth, and a drider, killed a spider, hurt everything else
* daina kills 2 spiders, tries to kill the draegloth, hears 'poor frustrated dwarf, you will serve the aboleth nicely as a scion' in undercommon
* i got screwed by confusion, lost a turn
* we also got covered in darkness
* finn told everyone to get out of the darkness, tried to hit drider that ran, but missed
* dune tried to attack a spider threatening stalwart, but missed
* daina beat the shit out of the draegloth
* stalwart got out of the dark, then knocked the draegloth down, then smashed the shit out of the draegloth
* randall went over to nocturnus and inspired him to get up and get moving
* nocturnus attacks the downed draegloth, killed it with nightmare
    as he stabs it, it goes to smoke thanos style, gets absorbed into the sword
    when darkness hits sword, nocturnus loses all hair
    and he looks like he lost 25 pounds
* spider hits me in the darkness
* irethia gets out of the dark, and firebolts a draegloth twice for major dmg (breaks darkness concentration)
* irethia then takes longbow shots from a drider
* daina got an opportunity attack first though
* sprocket firebolts the spider near me, kills it
* barden gets slashed by the draegloth, but gets an opportunity attack
* i shoot the remaining draegloth twice, for good dmg
* finn also shoots the draegloth, hit and miss
* daina slashes the draegloth, it's pointing at her, and still alive
* stalwart shoves the draegloth into the pestilence, tries to attack something else, misses, but takes an opportunity bite
* nocturnus attacks the drider, kills it with nightmare (cuts across torso, and takes head off)
    creature goes to smoke, sword absorbs, but nothing else obvious happens
* barden GTFO the fire
* irethia misses with a firebolt
* sprocket mind-spikes the draegloth, but doesn't kill it
* another darkness cast over by the draegloth
* then something picked daina's pack, and stole her axe (within darkness)
